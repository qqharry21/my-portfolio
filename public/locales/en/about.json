Because of the excellent education, my parents have given me since I was a child, I think I am a person who is full of enthusiasm, responsible, active learning, and can get along well with the team.\n\n During the study, I found that I was often addicted to the process of writing code, and I also discovered my interest when exploring uncharted territory.\n\n Therefore, I am determined to become an excellent programmer. I use online resources to study and observe the logic and writing of other engineers, thereby improving my program ability and quality in my spare time.",
