During my tenure as the head of the club, I not only successfully held many club activities, but also learned a lot about leadership, including club management, organization, operation, development, etc., among which I also learned how to communicate and coordinate in the team, so I think I am a nice and responsible person in the team and can play an important role in the team. \n\nThe project in the third year and the internship in the fourth year greatly improved my practical experience in the front-end and back-end of web pages, and also ignited my enthusiasm for web programming.Now I am working as a Java engineer in Matic, and I follow the team to complete two project development, in which I cultivate good programming habits and the ability to maintain team programs.
